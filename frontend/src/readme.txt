Were there areas of unexpected complexity? If so, how did you handle them or how did you decide to cut scope?

Yes, specifically the inclusion of images took us quite some time and we had to cut some functionality there. Because of storing it in the backend, we ended up having to rewire a good chunk of the program to make ends meet on that part.

What was the most interesting part of the final project?

The most interesting portion of the final project for us was to actually allow users to upload custom images to the database, since that's something we hadn't done before. Although it ended up being relatively difficult as a result, I do think it was an interesting problem to face.

If you had more time, what do you wish you could have added to the final project?

I wish we could've added further functionality, such as adding dual-type Pokemon to the battler or even just adding the rest of the types, alongside proper functionality for customization. It'd have been nice to make it work.
